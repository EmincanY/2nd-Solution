# Kaggle-Competition-2nd-Solution - Emincan Yilmaz

This repository contains the notebook and other files related to the Kaggle Competition where I ranked 2nd out of 1429 teams worldwide. 

After cloning, you can open the Jupyter Notebook and run the `PerfectNotebook_Emincan.ipynb` file. 
The file can be modified and adapted for other regression tasks in different competitions or projects by making minor changes specific to the new context.
